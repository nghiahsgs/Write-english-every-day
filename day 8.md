THE REPORT
Lee sat among the books at the library and thought about his group project
They had to turn it in soon, but he hadn't even started his part !
jack and Claire were in his group
They had worked hard
They were also very smart, and Lee didn't want them to get a bad grade

Jack did the report. 
He wrote a lot of very good sentences and described things with great adjectives. Claire drew a nice map of the stars
Now, Lee needed to do his part of the project

"Well, I suppose I need to start my model" Lee thought

Making a model of a planet was really hard
Lee tried to read several books, but he couldn't comprehend any of the charts
"We are going to fail because of me" Lee said
He put his head down the table and said "I wish I could see a planet, instead of having to read about it!"

Suddenly, there was a bright light. 
Lee was pulled from his chair, through the roof, and right into a strange ship
"Hello kid" said alien "Did you ask for help?"

Lee told the friendly alien all about his project
The alien agreed to help Lee solve his problem
"First, we will fly through space to view the universe"
"Then I can help you make a model of my planet"

Soon, they were going through the clouds.
They passed the moon
Then they viewed Mars
Lee was very excited
Instead of a bad grade, his group would have the best project ever

"It is time to go home" the alien finally said
On the way back, he helped Lee make a model of the planet Mars
Soon, they were on Earth

"Thanks" Lee said
"My model will be awesome"
Then he took his model and said goodbye to his new friend

We have two ears and one mouth, so we should listen more than we say
Let's imagine that you are watching an English clip. There are so many words thay you don't recognize. After looking at the subtiles, you are surprised "Oh man, I know those words, Why did I not recognize them?"

Is that situation familiar ? The reason is simple. You haven't spent enough time listening to that word to recognize it upon the first encounter. If you know this secret, you will agree with me that listening is the easiest skill to practice. Since the only thing you need to spend is time. But to save time, you need the right strategy. So how do we defeat this "enemy" by "guerrilla listening" skill ?

"Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories" ~Sun Tzu. I divided this "enemy" - or the English vocabulary into three areas

Familiar (F): They are simple words that we see everyday. We can recognize them easily among other words. Eg Internet, mobile, family ...

Sound Familiar (SF) : They are the words that you have seen before but rarely used them. So it's harder to recognize them the first time you hear them. Eg: compile, decode, testimonial ...

Strange (S) : They are new words to you, Eg. Hullabaloo, Poppcock, Lollygag

Take any English book, or simply look at the English version of this book. Turn to any page and start counting the words. You will see that 80%
