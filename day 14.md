If you wait for inspiration for write you are not a writer , you are a waiter
In my opinion, writing is the hardest skill to master. The reason is simple. People find it hard to write in their own mother tongue, not to mention writing is a foreign language. But few people know that when you are good at writing, you can master other skills quickly, including speaking.

One who speaks a lot may be bad at writing, but one who can write well, surely will speak well. I found this from my own experience. My good presentation skills came from writing. I prepared my presentation by writing whatever I was going to say, and saw that my speaking skill became better and better. Do you notice that when we are writing, we also speak a lot to ourselves? (and future audiences, too?)

Moreover, practice makes perfect. The more you use something, the easier it becomes to use it. But not everyone has a chance to practice English every day,even if one works in a foreign company or institution , their english skills won't inprive much if they only say hello to their foreign colleagues, or do a little work with them.

So writing is a useful tool for mastering language (including the mother tongue). But how do we practice it effectively ? Post an English status on Facebook ? Write an English diaty ? They are not bad ideas. The only problem is that you need a perfect model, just like listening or reading. You need someone to make corrections for you if you want to improve

If you visit mrsusu.com, you will see some of my Eng  posts. Actually, I hired a foreign freelancer to correct them with a proper price : 1usd for 250 words. I concluded that learning from my own mistakes was the most effective way to improve my writing skill. It was also cheaper. If I write 4 posts per month, and each post contains 1000 words, then it only costs 16$/month. It is a very reasonable proce for studying directly from foreigners. And I  alse created Ouchmaster.com for us to practice with support from foreigners and English teacher with a very suitable price.

Of course, there is a FREE way that also helps you improve your writing. I learned this gurrilla technique from an old colleague. When I first met him, his English was zero. The reason was not laziness, or because he refused to study. In high school. he focused on Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. In university, he chose Chinese instead of English. But after one years studying English, I saw him reading English documents, watching English videos, and even participating in some courses taught by foreign teachers and getting certified... His secret is simple: I named it "write like a child"

Do you remember your first time in school that the teacher read something and you had to write it down? In that situation, the teacher is your ideal model that helps you improve your writing. I see that people citicize copying and encourage creativity. It is reasonable for mother tongue, but not fore learning a foreign language. It is said that you must walk before you can run; I think you must "copy-write" before you can write.

But how to "copy write" effectively ? My old collegue had subscribed to many websites of foreign speakers so he received their emails every day. When he found something interesting, he typed again and posted it on Facebook. One stone kills two birds. The first bird: he had a free witing teacher. The second bird: his friends admired him for his good writing.

What he can do, so can you ! Just begin subscribing to some good websites like: www.lifehack.org; www.earlytorise.com; www.briantracy.com ; etc ... to receive positive newletters. If you have an interst in presentation skills, just subscrive to www.52speakingtips.com and start receiving great tips from Craig Valentine - The 1999 world champion of public speaking. The best part is that he sends you both text and audio files. My skills have improved so much thanks to his materials.

The secret key of this guerrilla weapon, is that you must write (or type) by your own hand (or keyboard). Don't copy and paste ! (That's why I call it "copy write" not copy paste). When you accumulate a sufficient amount of time "copy writing" (such as you have finished  "copy-write" your favourite book), you are now ready for real writing.

What will you write now ?

It is said you must walk before you run. But I suggest that you should walk fast before you run. Just practice making new sentences. You can put small notes with vocabulary in a box, then pick a note randomly and make a new sentence with the word.

The key here is bring your emotion into the sentences to impress the brain. Let is say that you picked the word "house", instead of creating a boring sentence like "That is a big house", try making a sentence like  "My futute house will be very big with a helipad"- that'll make you feel amazing!

Another way is to pick 7-10 random words each time, then try to create a funny and weird story to memorize all the words you picked. This will not only help you boost your creativity, but will also help you memorize all the words effectively. For more information on this method, please read my book Numagician.

The final way to practice writing is answering a random question. Just visit my web Phut59.com and click on "one question a day". You will see some random question. They are very inspiring questions that will help yo;u understand yourself, and pratice writing. You can also submit your questions to see how other members answer.
