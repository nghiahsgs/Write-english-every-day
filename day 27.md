Unit 25: JOE's POND
Jode made the world a better place. He got the idea to do that at school. He watched a video there. It was about a factory. This factory produced a lot of trash and put it in a river. The trash and water were a bad mix. People populated the area by the river and drank its water. This made them sick. Many of them needed medicine and made regular visits to doctors.

But the video wasn't all bad news. It showed ways to pick up track and why it's important to do this. It said people can make a difference to their environment. The video's important features made Joe associate trash with hurting people.

One day Joe walked through a park. He recognized some of the problems from the video. One instance of these problems was the trash in the pound. It was full of plastic cups. There was too much trash. Joe didn't want it to hurt anyone.

He told his grandfather about the park. His grandfather said "You know, it's a tradition in out family to help people. That's why we give food to poor people. Maybe you can help people be cleaning the park"

Cleaning the park would involve hard work. Joe decided to organize a group to help him. He chose a wide area of the park. It had the most trash. He asked his family and friends to come. On Saturday, he gave eveyone a sharp stick. They wondered why. He said "You use the stick's tip to pick up trash. This makes it easier" They worked for six weeks. Different people helped each time, but Joe was always there.

In that period of time, Joe saw a range of results. There was no trash in the water. People could swim in it. Jow know that was a good sign. He was happy because he helped his enviroment.

Unit 26: Archie and His Donkey
Old Archie needed some money. He decided to sell his donkey. So he and his son Tom went to town. It was situated many miles away.

Soon, they met a woman. "Where are you going?" she asked.

"to town" said Archie.

"Any smart person would ride the donkey" she said.

"What are you implying?" Archie asked "I am very smart!" Archie wanted to look smart. So he climbed onto the donkey. Then they continued in the direction of the town. 

Further along the road, they met a farmer.

"Hello" said Archie. "We want to sell this donkey. Do you want to buy it?"

"I don't need a donkey" said the farmer. "But if you want my advice, don't ride it. The donkey needs to be in good physical condition"

"Good idea" said Archie "Tom I want you to ride it. You are lighter"

"Neither you nor your son should ride it. It looks very tired. You shoould carry the the donkey" suggested the farmer.

"You are right" said Archie "Come on, Tom! We will carry it for the final few miles"

The donkey was very heavy, and they couldn't maintain a good speed. They didn't arrive until late in the evening. At last, they walked into the town. But there they attracted the attention of some teenage boys. They laughed at Tom and Archie. They started to throw stones at them. The donkey reacted by kicking. Tom and Archie dropped the donkey. It fell on the ground and then ran away. Archie lost his donkey. He went home with no money.

What does this story teach us ? We cannot please everyone in our society. Don't take everyone's advice, but set your own  standards. Prove to everyone that you can make decisions by yourself. Otherwise, you may end up with nothing at all.

Unit 27: The spider and the bird

There was once a very big spider. If a bug got into his web, he would examine it. However, he didn't eat the bug right away. He asked the bug a question first. It was always quite a difficult puzzle. If the bug's answer was correct, he let it go. If not, he ate it.

One day, a small bird on a journey flew into the spider's web. The spider couldn't imagine eating a bird. It was so big. But his hunger was too great. He said to the bird. "If you cannot give me a specific answer, I will eat you"

The bird laughed ""I could eat you" But the bird was actually scared. She has used all her energy trying to get out of the web. And a spider's bite can be very effective in killing animals.

"Please don't eat me" the bird said "I would rather make a deal with you"

"OK" the spider said "If your answer is right, I will let you go. If not, you must give me a gift. It must be something of great value"

The bird said "You can pick anything you want to eat. I will find it for you" The spider agreed.

"Where can you take a trip to the coast, the desert and the moutains at the same time?" The spider asked.

The bird asked "Does this place have earthquakes?" But the spider did not say anything "I can see those places when I fly. Is the sky the right answer"

"False" said the spider. "The answer is Hawaii. Now you must find some bugs for me"

The spider climbed on the bird's back. They flew and ate bugs together. The took a tour of the forest. Then the bird took the spider home. From that day on, they were friends. And they never tried to eat each other again
