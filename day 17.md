Learning English by computer games
Talking about computes and devices, it's a mistake if we don't mention games. I am a gamer, too. Sometimes I say to my friends that most of my English vocabulary came from computer games.

But games are dangerous, so how do we use them effectively? I think only these three genres of games will truly help you in studying English. The others are mainly for entertainment purpose.

The first is games designed for stufying languages. I have nothing to say about this.

The second is point n cllick adventure games (including puzzles to solve) Eg Monkey Island, Siberia...

The third is role playing games with well-written stories. Eg. Final fantasy, Ocean Star, Grandia .. this is my favorite genre. The keyword to find them on Google is "top JRPG games"

I prefer classic 2D games (Super NIntendo Emulation, Snes 9x) because they can run on any old PC and even on smartphones. And they were created in the time that 3D graphics were still new, so I feel that the creators invested much of their time in content and music.

In conclusion, whether high tech devices are friends or foes depends on out choices. BE wise


Dont wait for the perfect moment. Take the moment and make it perfect.

So you have been throgh some of the guerrilla weapons in the war with English. As you can see, those techniques can apply to any language, not only English

Why did I say "some" ? Because knowledge is unlimited, and there are so many methods waiting to be discoverd. I will update and develop new and interesting weapons in the full version of this book. Below are some questions that people often ask me, and I hope you will find them useful

SHould I study in an English center?

It depends on your purpose. If you want some certificates, I think you should. If you are just like me, and you just want enough to use in your life, you dont need to go to any class. But you still need some English clubs (online or offline are both ok) to test your current level.

What should I do to memorize words easily ?
As I have already said, dont memmorize words separately. You should study them in a whole sentence, and build your vocabulary up with the suggestions in this book. In case you need to memorize new words as your teacher requires, you can apply some tricks on my blog:
Vitasusu Technique
Cucasusu Technique:

How to memorize grammar structures?
Once again , do not learn grammer structures separately, study them in a specific sentence, then the structure will go deeply into your mind slowly. Note: Making some funny sentences will help you memorize them longer.

For your interest:

My English is zero, how to be a hero?

In that case, you should attend a class or some basic course. I recommend you try Pimsleur Audio.

How to fight against laziness?

Dont fight it until you know the nature of laziness. In my opinion, there are three types of laziness:
Lack of motivation
The common reason is that you dont know why you need to study . The best way to solve this problem is to set a new higher goal. Eg I can watch foreign movies without looking at subtitles, travelling abroad, get IELTS 8.0 certificate...

Lack of method:
You may have motivation, but difficulties may knock you down. YOu need some new way to get through difficulties. Just read books, surf the Internet for a new approach to what you need.

Lack of environment
I think there are two types of peole. One has and independent personality, and after setting a goal,nothing can stop them. The other needs friends around them to keep them going, so participation in a class or an English club is necessary.


Everything will be okay in the end. If it is not okay, it is not the end.
Summary
Throughout this small book, I strongly believe that you have been given many useful tools for the war with English ahead. Let is summarize them all.

The nature of any language is the powerful connection between the ideas in your head, and the related spoken words. To master a mother tongue, everyone uses this process: Listening Speaking Reading Writing. But it is not easy to apply this to a second language. So I found some guerrila teachniques that are based on the nature of language learning.

Listening: If you cannot recognize some words, it is simply that you have not spent enough time on that word. Keep practicing listening, but rememer this mantra: listen to a one minute clip 100 times.

Speaking: while practicing listening, you can practice speaking , too. Just download all your fovorite clips to your smartphone or MP3 device, then try to speak like the speakers as accurately as possible.

Reading: Begin reading your favourite fiction or nonfiction books bilingually, follow three steps: Read some Vietnamese sentences, then imagine vividly what the author is trying to tell you, then read the English version. The feeling of "read fast , understand quickly" will inspire you !

Writing: Practice "copy write" before you write. Just subscibe to some newsletters, and begin to retype (or rewrite) the story you like, the quote you like, or even your favourite books.

And much more: If you forger, dont hesitate to read this book again. I hope English will soon become your "father tongue"!
