of couse, ifyou choose the right clip, it never bores you. The '1 minute' is only symbolic. I often choose presentation clips of professional speakers which are 5-7 minutes in length, and listen to them regularly for two weeks. I prefer them because the speakers will choose their words carefully when presenting in public. It also improve my presentation skills, sometimes I see myself talking to inspirationally just like them.
To find those clips above, you can visit TED.com or Google "Toastmaster World Champion". Don'f forget to download (or buy) into your devices. A small tip is that you sholld conver them to MP3 files, and copy to you smartphone so you can enjoy them anytime, anywhere. The clip is intended for the first time watching.
Note that the first few times you watch the clip, you sholld use subtitles (Either English or Vietnames subtitles are ok) to make sure that you can imagine what they said. This is important, because if you don't understand what you are listening to or cannot imagine what they are talking about, thre will be consequences. The first is the bad feeling about your listening skill, the second is that words cannot link to any ideas.
Another thing ti notice is the time you listen. TO create the new habit of listening, just link it to another habit that you have already developed. I often listen to audios before sleeping to impress the brain. Moreover, after a hard day, an inspirational clip will refresh you mind with positive thoughts.
Besides, if you want to sleep better, and improve your english right after waking up, you can google "guided sleeping audio" and download tons of relaxing audios which can guide you to a better sleep (They also consist of a huge vocabulary on relaxation). I prefer Paul Santisi; you can search for him on youtube and find the most interesing audio files - He has recorded around 1000 positive compliments in 3D sound  that will make you smile before going to a deep sleep.
Once again, memorizing 100 words is not better than mastering only one word. Please spand at least two weeks listening to one clips or autdio again and again before moving to the next. If you do that, the result will be fantastic. How about speaking ? Let's reveal the No.2 Guerrilla weapon.
========There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve : the fear of failure
Do you remember the child who cried "ppaa pppbbaa" If the father yells "Wrong it's papa". What will the child do ? He will think "Oh i am terrible" and keep silent for the rest of his life ? NO he looks at his father's mouth and keep practicing "Paa ppaa" until the pefect word "papa" comes out
Suppose that each mistake we make is one time we fall down and yell "Ouch", you will see that children don't hesitate to Ouch, they stand up quickly. I believe that God wrote in their gene on mantra "Falling donw is not scary, because it will move you forward"
One simple truth. we were all once children: we were not afraid of falling down, we didn't fear the Ouch. Because of the Ouch, we grew up, we moved forward ... Until one day , we started to fear the Ouch and said "I am not good" "Let's do it next time"
If you need 800 hourse of listening to make the brain familiar with English, then I believe that we to double that amoun of time, 1600 hours to speak it fluently. So if you are afaid of wrong pronounciation. and do not begin now, how can you accumulate enough time for speaking  ? So let's become and OuchMaster , just speak and fix later.
The good news is that you don't have to pronounce perfectly in the whole 1600 hours, but you need a perfect model. Like the baby needs his parents talking as a learning model, you need an English enviroment like that (With native English speakers) Here is the problem : It's hard to do what when we are adults (It's not easy to face someone and call him "papa") So what will we do ?
It's time to open the mystery box of "Guerulla Speaking Weapon"
