People fear what they don't understand and hate what they can't conquer
Is foreign language scary ?
English is a voracious bear. It eats almost all words of humanity, from televison, radio, newspapers to the internet, even in our daily conversation. It also eats tons of time and money that people invest in studying English. Many people spend 12 years in school, 4 years in college, and a lot of money for English centers, but their English is still not good.

I understand this. After more then ten years of studying English, I had a great opportunity when i met with Antonio Graceffo - a martial artist, and an author who can speak more then five languages. When we were on the street, he told me, "I want a cold Coke". But I couldn't figure out what he wanted, that made him so upset. At that time, I felt the bear and slapped my self-esteem in its face.

People only fear what they don't understand. I used to think a foreign language is scary like that bear. Until I found out the true nature of language, the bear suddenly became docile and extraordinary lovely. Love is the foundation of any achievements. Now let's find out the true nature of language through an experiment : do you know any fruit that is long-shaped, yellow colored, and soft to the touch ?

99% people answered me "qua chuoi" (a banana) , the 1% remaining chose a yellow ballon or some secret things that made them smile. But i wonder why no one answered "banana"? Of course, they are Vietnamese. If they were English, the answer "banana" would pop out.

The true nature of language is simple. It is a tool that people created to help them share ideas effectively. Why should someone fear what he created ? Thanks to language, you dont't have to explain to a sales clerk at the marketplace "I want to buy a fruit that is long-shaped, yellow colored and soft to the touch ..." just saying "banana" is enough to draw a picture in her mind

Why does the word "banana" appear ? Because the brain has memorized it. How does the brain memorize it ? After many years of picking the banana, eating the banana, and sometimes slipping on a banana peel ... an idea about something "long-shaped, yellow colored and soft to the touch" has become strongly connected to the word "banana". If yout mother language is not English, that idea will link to the different word.

English has about 3000-5000 common words. I uploaded all vocabulary from grade 1 to 12 onto a website called Phut59.com and saw that there were 5000 words. So if someone completed 12 years of schooling, he must be good at English ! But why many of them feel hopeless when using English to communicate in real life ?

Through the experiment above, I realized the problem is that the way we learned foreign language went against the nature of language. Instead of linking directly between words and an ideas, between the word "banana" and an idea about "long-shaped, yellow and soft to the touch" thing, I spent years memorizing word lists, which aim to link indirectly the word "banana" to the foreign word "qua chuoi". Did you do that , too ?

People are strange. They want to break the rules of Nature and create difficulties for themselves. When I watching my friends speaking English fluently, I told myself "they have talents I don't have, so I'm bad.That's OK"

Until I realized a simple truth : before I could speak any language, my mother tongue was a foreign language too. The problem was that I did not use the way I learned my mother tongue to learn English. Now let's look at a process that helps a child master his mother tongue.

Step1: Listening : Adults may know many things, but always lose to children on this ability. When you talk to a child, it will listen in silence then smile (sometimes cry). You remeber Antonio ? he said to me "to master a language, you need at least 800 hours of listening" But how do we practice listening effectively ? The guerilla weapon NO.1 will help you do this.

Step 2: When a baby opens his mouth to say the first word "pppaaa". Is there any father who yells at it "You're wrong, It must be papa". No! any father will smile happily and say the word "papa" again. The baby will speak that word again and again util it is perfect. Once the baby can talk, it will talk so much. Guerilla No.2 will help you speak English more confidently , more fluently.

Step 3-4: Reading and Writing : Remember your childhood, after speaking well, you went to school and learned how to read the Alphabet, then practiced writing exactly what the teacher did.

These four steps help us master "the first foreign language" in a very natural way : Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. But look at how people study their second foreign language. At first, their purpose is to pass the exams, which includes so much writing and reading, speaking and listening are not highly rated. This wrong way of learning explains why their English is poor, after years of studying. They may get a high score in highschool, but a bad score in lifeschool.

In conclusion, English, or any language, is just a language. The essence of mastering a language is the strong and direct linking between words and ideas you need to describe to others. Both English and Vietnamese are languages, if you have mastered Vietnamese, it's such a lie to say that you are unable to master English. The problem is to find the solution.

With guerrilla weapons based on the deep and simple foundation above, I believe that studying English is extremely useful and effective. Because it has a clear vision : help you improve your English skills so your English is equally good as (or even better than) your Vietnamese
