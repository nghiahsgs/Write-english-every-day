Fususu-Nguyen Chu Nam Phuong
Foreword from a good friend

One afternoon in 2010, I met Nam Phuong in a self-help course. At that time, he had a nickname "Phuong Live" with a well-known blog. His deep messages about life had made many middle-aged people like me shocked, because he was just 19 years old.

In 2011, we founded "ban be tot" club with nearly 2000 members, encouraging each other by positive posts and actions. Besides, we helped them study english and had some offline events with good memories. That non-profit project was not successful as we expected but we have learned a lot of valuable lessons about friendship, sharing and overcoming difficulties

After that, Phuong followed his path to become a Trainer specialized in accelerated learning for pupils. I focused on researching English in tourism and hotels, specialize in teaching for bank directors. I also translated some best-selling books about business and entrepreneuship

Six years later, though we rarely met, the passion of helping the young generation has pulled us back. Together, we founded Ouchmaster- a club that helps people improve their English by making excellent presentations. Although Phuong does not identify himself as an English teacher, I confirm that this is a extremely unique, useful handbook for self-study, and it will surely help you shorten the time of mastering English skills

These techniques have been tested in our clubs and also through my personal experience in coaching and teaching the English subject to more than 2500 students for over six years.

Hope you have great experiences and fantastic results with this handbook.

Honestly, i am not an English teacher, i have not got any IELTS or TOEFL certificates, either. Moreover, i had to study English from scratch when I was 12 years old. But when i was 13 (after only one year of studying), i was chosen to participate in an English competition. Although i didn't win that time, my score for this subject was always among the top, and in some semesters, my final scores were nearly 10.00

Until now, i am not an English teacher, i have not got any certificates yet. But i am confident that my current English skills can help me:
+ Use any computer software, from programing, music compilation to graphic design... my friends often exclaim that I am a computer genius.The truth is I just follow the English instructions for that software

+ Read useful English materials that improve my job. By finding an English ebook on presentations and mastering the teachiques introduced, though I am introverted man, many people have commented that I have got very charming presentations

+ And much more: sometimes I interpret during meetings between my bosses and foreigners, make English presentations, translate subtitles, or even write Blog posts and books in English. As you can see this book is bilingual.

In general,I am happy with my current skills.And it would be selfish if I didn't share my secret that has helped me so much. This is just a small book, but i believe it will save you a huge amount of time and monney investing in study English- an essential language.

This book consists of eight parts.The first part is the most significant. It will help you understand the true natural of language. The next parts will give you many unique and specific tools to improve your skills, I call them "guerrilla weapons" and they are numbered from #1 to #7. If you apply them regualarly, your skills will surely improve everyday, even when you are sleepings ! (That's why i called them "guerrilla" techniques)

Besides, you will see that i write bilingually, but the purpose is not to show off my ability. This is also part of this method.Moreover, it helps fulfil my commitment on the cover "improve your english immediatedy after reading". Of course, you need to read the English version

Nothing is perfect, including me and this book.If you find any error or have something to say, I am happy to hear them at ".../feedback" Besides, i have a hobby of giving free stuff to those who leave feedback. You are welcome to give some comments on this book. Watch out for surprise gifts later, my friends

Hope to hear from you soon
