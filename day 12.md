When I was young, my mother sent me to my aunt's home in Hai Phong city. I did something that had a profund effect on my belief in studying language. There was a TV with a (maybe) broken remote control, that forced me to watch only the History Channel for three days. My English was so bad, I did not understand anything; so I just watched maninly the images. It was so boring that I have a great idea. I made up my mind to try to mimic exactly what the broadcasters were doing on TV. It was hard at first because they spoke so fast, but I tried to follow them, omiiting what I didn't catch

After three days doing that, i discovered two interesting facts. The first : I was able to copy nearly exactly their pronounciation (though I did understand anything). The second : I began to recognize some familiar words, and evend successded in guessing thier meanings when watching the images on TV. Since then, I had developed a habit of copying exactly what I had heard in English, until ine day I discovered that English was not as hard as I thought

Do you know what to do now ? Let's use the weapon in combinantion with No.1 weapon. After listening to a clip a few tims (or you begin to feel bored), let's refresh by trying to speak exactly after the speaker : from speed, tone to accenting. If nobody is around, you can speak out loud. Whispering is OK, but you must speak.

At first, you may not understand or keep up with the speaker, but don't worry. What is the most important thing when you are practicing speaking ? It's speaking itself. So don't think, just speak, speak and speak .. wrong pronounciation is OK, no one is there to criticize you. Moreover, you will be better each time you do it again. The key point here is to listen and copy as quickly as you can, util you feel that you speak exactly as the speaker.

There will be a time, you begin to realize that if the essence of good listening is transforming words form "SF" are to "F" are. then the nature of well-spoken English is that you master the phrases. This does not depend on studying in an English center or studying at home.

I am not against going to English center; it has its own benefits. If your English teacher give you 20 pharase to practice in 2 hours, you will spend 120/20=6 minutes per phrase (mmp). In reality , it's less than 6 mmp because there are many activities in the classroom, and tou cannot speak continously, so i believe the real amount of time for each phrase is maximum 2 mpp. Too little to master it. It explains why people are not improving their speaking skill.

The advantage of this method is that you can do it continously anytime, anywhere you like with an Mp3 device. The average speaker's speed is around 100 wpm (words per minute).If there are around 10 words in a phrase (or sentence), then in one minute watching a presentation clip, you learn 10 phrases.If you speend 100 minutes copying a one-minutespeech, the resualt will be 10 mpp, more then five times the method above.

Once again, I don't appose any English class that teachers speaking skills, they have their own benefits.And I don't need to remind you of their benefits.I just said that if you have determination, and you have a method, nothing is impossible

If you apply this method to your favourite clips, it will boost your confidence when you talk about those topics in English. If you just want to improve your communication skills in daily life, just google "1000 common English pharase"- You will have them totally FREE!

One secret: this is also a tip that helps me present well before hundreds of people. There was a time I brought my laptop to the riverside of red river with my old colleague. We played a clip of a world champion in public speaking, then copied exactly what he did : from hand movements to what he said. It was such a wonderful moment!

You may decide that you don't need an English class, but you still need an environment that helps you test your skills. I recommend Toastmaster, an international presentaiton club with many foreign members.

We have a club named Anyone Can Inspire (ACI) with two versions, one in vietnamese and the other in English. When presenting, If you cannot describe something in English, We will help you immediately.The most intersting thing is that the rules of this club don't let people criticize, everyone must give compliments, so the confidence of members skyrockets
