Unit 23: The CAMP
Stacie wanted to stay at a nice hotel for vacation. But her parents sent her to a terrible camp instead. For breakfast, Stacie liked fresh juice and chocolate milk, but she got water at the camp. The the afternoon she wanted to write poems, but she had to swim. The camp was near an airport with loud planes. Spider webs hung over her bed. To her, the kids' everage behavior was very bad. No girl matched her personality. She hated it.

One day, they had a class. Mental exercise sounded good to Stacie. But it was a course on water safety. They learned how to be safe passengers on a boat. Stacie didn't ever plan to go on a boat.

The next day, they played a game. There were a red team and a blue team. Stacie was on the blue team. Each team had try to remove the other team's flag from a pole. They also had to use water guns. "I am not much of an athlete" she said. But she still had to play.

Stacie took a water gun and looked for somewhere to hide. A boy said "Stacie you advance to the middle. I will go right. Those two will go left"

Stacie still didn't want to play. She walked in the forest and saw a red team player coming. Stacie hid behind a tree and then jumped out and shot the other player. "This is fun" Stacie thought.

Several minutes after advancing futher, Stacie saw the red flag. A read team member was watching over it. She shot him with her water gun. Then she lowered the flag and ran back to her team. "I got it" she yelled. The blue team won. Stacie was the hero.

For the rest of the week, Stacie had fund. She even made new friends.
