Curiosity. Millions saw the apple fall, but Newton asked why
What is WIT
If you look up in English-Vietnamese dictionary, the meaning is "great wisdom". If you look up in Fususu's dictionary, this is an abbreviation for "What is This?" the most effective way to build up your vocabulary

"What is this?" Antonio asked while punching in the air
"We call it ...Đấm" I answered
"Dam Dam Dam" He whispered several times
"What is this?" A simple but powerful question that has helped many generations of children master their mother-tongue

Right now, let's look at the objects around you. Are you sure that you can call out their names in English? IF not, the words you are learing are a bit far from reality

Try to create this habit: Each time you walk into a room, choose a random object and ask yourself:" What is this?" If you can answer quickly, it's good. If not, you know what to do. Just open a Vietnamese-English dictionary and look for that word!

This is a simple guerilla weapon, but very effective for these reasons: Firstly, you are the one who seeks for that world, you are proactive. Secondly, these objects are familiar so the chance you will use them in the future is very high (imagine a foreigner visiting your home)

When ojects near you or the "What is this" question becomes too easy for you, you are ready for the next level with advanced questions:
Ask this when you wake up :"What is the most important thing to do today?" This is  a must-ask question of any effective time manager

SOmetimes in your day, ask this "What am I doing?" This question helps you be aware of the present and detaches you from temptations, preventing you speding too much time on playing computer games, watching movies, etc

When you see someone, ask yourself:"What is he/she doing?" or when you are on the road and see something new, "What is happening?" These question help improve your observation skills and be able to describe things happening around you.

Before going to bed, ask yourself:"What makes me proud today?" This question will boost your self-esteem, help you practice postitive thinking, and have a better sleep.

You  can write you own question or google "100 important questions" But remember that you must master this most important question first :"What is this?"

Note: Our purpose is building vocabulary, so when you are answering in English, you dont need to perfect in grammar or pronunciation. Just focus on keywords. If you dont know the words in English, just use a dictionary. So, always bring a small Vietnamese-English dictonary along, or simply use a smartphone with a dictionary installed instead.

"Life is what happens to you while you are looking at your smartphone"
Turn your computer and smartphones into allies

Mastering a foreign language requires endurance; you need to spend tome on it every day. But what do most people do in their free time ? I suspect that they spend at least 50% of their time on smart phones and computer. So why not turn them into useful weapons for studying?

Change the display language in software
I see that most people using Facebook with their mother-tongue as the interface language and they rarely change it. Just switch the language to English, then you will master a bunch of new words in a short time.

Facebook suppoer hundreds of languages  all over the world. Just make sure that you are familiar with any function and button on their websire, and then switch to any language that you want to master. From French to Laoian

Non only Facebook, switch the language for any application on your computer to english, form Ms Office, Chrome, Firefox, To gmail, yahoo.. then I bet that the feeling of "read fast and understand quickly" will make you very surprsed!

The secret key of this method is that you must understand all functions of that software before switching to the other language. This helps create direct links between words and ideas in any language you want
