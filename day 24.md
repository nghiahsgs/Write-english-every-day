UNIT 18: The little red chicken
A little red chicken had a store in a small town. She sold many different items to people in the town. The people loved her products.

One day, a cat came to her property. He saw the sign that indicated where the chicken's store was located. He wanted to purchase bread, but the chicken's store was almost empty. She had only a bag of wheat

"You can use the wheat to make bread" the chicken said.

"No I don't want to work" the cat said "I just want to buy bread" The cat became angry and left the store.

Later, the little red chicken saw the cat in a crowd.

"I will help you make the bread" she said.

But the cat treated her badly. He did not even communicate with her.

He did not want to do any work.

So the chicken decided to make the bread. She selected the exact amount of wheat to make fresh bread. She used a stone to pound the wheat to get it ready. Soon, her bread was ready.

The cat came and saw the bread on a dish.

"Give me some of your bread" he said.

"No" said the little red chicken "You did not help me make me make the bread. SO you shall not have any to eat"

The cat argued with the chicken. He tried to offer a price for it. But the little red chicken did not want to sell her bread.

"Don't depend on others to do work for you" said the little red chicken.

"Then how will I get bread?" the cat asked.

"I recommend doing some work" said the little red chicken "Use a tool to plant your own wheat. When it grows big,  you can gather it and make own bread. You need to learn to do work for what you want"
