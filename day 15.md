We born to be happy, not to be perfect

Einstein's Classroom
"Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results" Albert Einstein
That's my favourite quote of Einstein , the great scientist of the 20th century. It makes me wonder what am I doing over and over again and expect my English skills to improve?

I notice that people often study grammar and vocabulary separately, there is no strong connection. Meanwhile, when children grow up. the master their mother tongue by specific sentences through particular situations. They rarely learn form gammar and vocabulary separately. That makes me wonder how we can study grammar and vocabulary well at the same time ?

My first answer is to learn from quotes. Just collect famous quotes and study them, even learn them be heart. You will not only get inspired, but also find it easier than learning 10 separate words. A great reference is www.brainyquote.com a big collection of quotes classified in categories and by author.

I have a small collection for myself, almost all written by me, attached with inspirational pictutes, in both Vietnamese and English versions. You can download them using the link  at the end of the book, and set them as a desktop background. Dont forget to make them change automatically each time you login 

Another secret : this inspiring teachnique will not only help you in studying English, but will also improve your presentation and writing skills. Putting relevan quotes in your presentations or essays will make them more persuasive

Beside quotes, you can use positive affirmations. This is a classic exercise that many trainers will give you if you ask them how to be more confident. Try to read these affirmations below out loud.

I am a unique child of this world

I forgive myself for all mistakes I have made

Today will be a gorgeous day to remember

By googling "100 affirmations" you will find numerous positive affirmations like that. When I first discovered this teachnique, I printed them out, and read them out loud on my rooftop (sometimes in the bathroom) for 6 months. The result was astounding!
