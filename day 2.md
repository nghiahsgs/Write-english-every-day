Notice to all teachers!
This memo is to inform you of the following situation.
Last week the office caught several students cheating on exams.
They were using their cell phones to text message answers to other students
I want all teachers to collect their student's cell phones before every exam
Cheating will not be tolerated
If students are caught with cell phones during a test, it will automatically be considered cheating
The student will receive an F and two-day suspension from school
Thank you for your assistance
