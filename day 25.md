Unit 20: The Seven Cities of Gold

Many years ago, a Spanish officer named Coronado heard the story of seven great cities. "The walls of these cities are mde of gold" his friends told him "The people eat meat from golden plates and fress in nice clothes" they said. They called these cities the Seven Cities of Gold. Were the cities real? Coronado never considered asking his friends.

Coranado thought to himself, "The things in these cities must be worth a lot of money" So he went to find the Seven Cities of Gold. He took along three hundred men, many horses, and extra food. The headed west. Coronado wanted to achieve his goal very badly.

Coronado and his men rode for many days. Then they saw some cities "We found the Seven Cities of Gold" his mend yelled, but COronado wasn't happy. He had a different opinion. "These can't be the Seven Cities of Gold" he said. "Look, they're made of dirt"

Coronado was right. The cities weren't bright and golden. They were dirty and brown. The people didn't eat meat from golden plates. They ate vegetables from regular bowls. They wore the most basic clothes.

Coronado regarded the cities as ugly places "What happened to the cities of gold?" he thought. "Did someone destroy them ? Was there a war? Did someone already come and take the gold?"

That night, the people of the cities entertained Coronado and his men and served them food. They advised Coronado to go home "There is no gold here" they told him. COronado was angry. Did his friends lie to him ?

He left the next morning. He looked back at s one more time. The sun reflected light dirt houses. Coronado thought he saw a bit of gold. Were his friends right after all . "No" he told himself. "It's just the sun" Then he turned away and went home.

Unit 21: KATY
I first met 8 year old Katy on a rainy afternoon. I was a nurse at a hospital. The clerk at the desk told me about Katy. She was there because she felt a lot of pain. The doctors located a problem at base of her brain. I knew she was special, even before she got better. I will always remember Katy as a hero.

When I entered Katy's room, she was not in her bed. She was in a chair next to Tommy, a little boy. Though Katy did not feel weel, she was playing with Tommy and his toys. It took a lot of effort for her just to sit in the chair. BUt she played with Tommy because it made him happy.

Katy was always smiling and never appeared to be in pain. She refused to just lie in bed. One day I found her painting a picture. Later, she gave it to one of the older patients. Another day she went outside to get flowers for another sick little girl. Katy made everyone smile.

The doctors hurried to fix the problem is Katy's brain. The operation was successful! The doctors informed the hospital staff of the good news. Katy was fine. She soon felt excellent. She got better and was able to leave the hospital a month later.

I have had a long career as a nurse. I have met many patients. However, I have never met another girl like Katy. Even after she got well, she still came to the hospital. She played various games with the young patients. She read many books to the older patients. Katy's kind heart helped her ger better so quickly. She is a hero to me and everyone else at the hospital.

Unit 22: A Better Reward
Jenny delivered food for a restaurant. She read the newspaper and said "Uh oh"  There was a story about a thief. He stole food, and no one had seen him. Even the police couldn't catch him. Jenny was a little scared. She worked close to that area.

The newspaper included a message from the police "If anything strange occurs, call us. If you help us catch the thief, you will earn a reward"

Jenny talked to Jim. He managed the restaurant "Do you know about the thief?"

"Yes" he said "But he steals more than one person can eat. And why haven't the police stopped him yet? It's a mystery. If you see him, contact the police. Don't run after him"

Jenny drove to a customer's house. She left her car and opened the gate to the house. But then she heard a noise by her car. She yelled "Thief" She wasn't scared. She wanted the reward. She did the opposite of what Jim told her to do.

"Hey" she yelled. "Got back here" She set the food on the ground and ran to her car.

But the thief had already left with the food. Jenny followed a noise around the corner. She was amazed. She saw a dog and some puppies. They were eating her food. They looked thin and scared "The actual thief is just a dog. She's feeding her puppies" she said "That's why she steals so much food"

Jenny felt bad. She tried to comfort the dogs wth another plate of food. Then she took them back to the store. Everyone there took a puppy home. Jenny called the police. She told them there was no real thief.

Jenny didn't do it to receive the reward anymore. She said "It was just a dog. But there's no charge for catching this thief" she said "My new dog is a better reward"
