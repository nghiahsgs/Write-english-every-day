in conclusion, be a child. Listen more, speak more, copy more. Don't be afraid, let the mistakes become your great teachers, and you will be OuchMaster. Till now, you may be confident with listening and speaking: How about reading ? The answer is just ahead, keep going !

Dont neglect your favourite books
Are you willing to tell me about your most favourite books or fiction ? It's so easy. But how about the features of Africa's literature in 1969 ? (Opps, that's a crazy question...)

your memmory is connected to your emotions. You tend to memorize what you like automatically and forget what you dont like. Whay not study language by using your favourite fiction or non-fiction books ?

Just find the English version of your favourite books and start reading again. A small book contains 20000-30000 words, and a small novel contains aroand 30000-50000 words. If you master all of that vocabulary, you can use it for the rest of your life.

There are some mistakes you must avoid

A long time ago, I bought the English version of the Harry Potter series and applied this teachnique. I gave up after a few days. Because there were many new words, and it took tons of time opening and closing my big dictionary. But when I mastered the process of creaing the habit (known as On teachnique in my first published book named "numagician"). the result was different. Instead of reading the whole English version, I read a small paragraph in the Vietnamese version, imagined it clearly in my mind, the read the corresponding papragraph in English version. The experience was great because I could undertans everything without a dictionary. So if you are reading bulingually to study English, keep three miracle steps in your mind:
1: Read 2-3 Vietnamese sentences
2: Imagine it in your mind as vividly as possible
3: Read the corresponding English paragraph

TipL You can take note of the new words in the Vietnamese version (like this). IT not only improves your memory, but alse prepares you for the writing skill. If you are lazy, just read with the three weapons above, and you will master the most common words in that book.

When you feel confident enough, you can challenge yourself with longer papragraphs, but dont exceed 5-7 sentences unless you have a super ability of visualizing. The secret here is that you must be able to visualize what the author describes, then read the corresponding English sentences to create direct links between ideas and words.

The next mistake is related to comics.

You may feel that it's easier to start with comics like Doraemon or Dragonball instead of textbooks. Be careful ! You can attracted to entertainment and forget the main goal. Moreover, like movies, comics contain lots of images. Besides, the author of comics will try to lower the rate of repeated words to keep readers' attention as heigh as possible. This nos not good because learning a language needs repetition, until we master it.

So if you use comics, please make sure that you've read them before so you can focus on the main goal. You can also choose one chapter thay you like most and read it again and again, till you can visualize exactly what the character said in each page (in English, of course)

The best books to use arr self-help books, because you can apply whay you learn to your own life. Fiction os Ok. According to my research on fiction writing, publishing a fiction book is not simple. The author must invest tons of time to research, write and rewrite. And the editor must check them carefully, so the grammar is perfect !

In conclusion, things you loved can make you love them even more when suing them in a new , proper way. Let's read your favourite books bilingually, and novels sentence by sentence ot paragraph by paragraph, the result will make an extraordinary difference.

So now, you know the reason why I'm trying to write this book bilingually. It not only helps me improve my English skills, but will also help you appy these teachniques and become better by the time you reach the last page. I also provided more space between the lines for you to take notes easily when you need to
