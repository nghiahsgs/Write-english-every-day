Familiar (F): They are simple words that we see everyday. We can recognize them easily among other words. Eg. Internet, mobile, family
Sound Familiar (SF): They are the words that you have seen before but rarely used them. So it is harder to recognize them the first time you hear them. Eg: compile, decode, testmonial
Strange(S): They are new words to you, Eg: Hullaballo, Poppycock, Lollygag
Take any English book, or simply look at the English version of this book. Turn to any page and start counting the words. You will see that 80-90% of the words belong to the "F" and "SF" areas. The remainiing 10-20% belong to the "S" area, depending on which kind of the book you are reading. The more specialized the book is, the more strange words you will encounter
Similarly, most words you encounter in daily life or common books belong to the "F" and "SF" ares. It is said that English has 3000 common words, and you only need learn these words to be proficient. Not really. Memorizing the word's meaning is not enough; you must make sure that your ears are familiar with those words- it means you can recognize theme whereever thet are at the first time listening to whatever materials
Suppose that you recognize 9 comman words in one sentence that has 10 words. The chan that you guess the meaning of the last word successfully will surely be higher than a man who knows only that one strange words, but does not recognize the other 9 words
Listening to one word 100 times is better than listening to 100 words one time. One who studies 300.000 words in a short time may not be better then one who masters 3000 common words in a long time. Instead of learning new, strange words, let's spend time making "sound familiar" words "familiar". How do we do that effectively ? Accumulating 800 hours of listening.
Suppose that in the last 10 years, we have watched an average on one foreign move each week. Suppose that each movie is 100 minutes in length, so we will have 10 years x 52 weeks x 100 minutes = 52.000 minutes or 867 hours of listening to a foreign language. In theory, we must have developed excellent listening skills by now ! But not so fast
The key point here is not the minutes you send watching movies, it is the amount of time for each word. If a moview has 10.000 words, we will spend 52.000 minutes / 10.000 words = 52 mpw (minutes per word). In fact this number will be smaller because movies include a lot of pictures and short sentences in conversation. Besides, the content of each move is different so the odd of listening to a word again is very low. I think the real minutes you spent for each word in ten years of watchung foreign moviews, is 1mpw. Too little to make an impression on our brain.
But if you open a clip that is 1 minute in length and has 100 words then you watch it agian and again, for 100 times, You spend only 100 minutes, but the result of 1mpw is the same as 10 years watching movies. So my mantra when practicing listening is "100 times 1 minute, better than 1 time 100 minutes"
You might say that watching something agian and again will be boring, But please remeber : boring is a sign that something is becoming familiar. And making something familiar is our main purpose in learning and language
Of course, if you choose the right clip, it never bores you. The "1 minute" is only symbolic. I often choose presentantion clips of professinal speakers which are 5-7 minutes in length, and listen to them regularly for two weeks. I prefer them because the speakers will choose their words carefully when presenting in public. It alse improves my presentantion skills, sometimes I see myself talking so inspirationally just like them.
