Unit 12: The Crazy Artist
Frenhofer was the best artist in the world. Everyone loved him. The quality of his paintings was very high. He always used the best materials. He made a big profit from his paintings. He had delicious meals with his his rich neighbors. He taught art classes. Life was good.

Then his attitude changed. He stopped selling paintings and teaching. He tried a new method of painting. He stayed alone in his apartment all day. He worked all day and all night, rarely eating. Soon Frenhofer became very thin. But he kept working on the same painting for many years. He worked as hard as he could.

Finally, he finished the painting. He was very happy and invited other artists to see it. "I want your professional opinion" he said. He wanted them to judge it and compare it to other paintings. Everyone was very excited as they went up the stairs to his aparment. Frenhofer was excited to show his painting, and the artists were excited to see it "They will love it" he thought. But they did not.

They were surprised by painting. There was no white anywhere. Frenhofer filled the whole painting whit lines and colors. There was no space for a normal picture. It was full of strange shapes. It looked bad to the other artists. He used symbols, and they didn't understand them. They thought it was terrible "Why did you paint this strange picture?" someone asked. They didn't understand its beauty.

But after some time, many people began to like his painting. People wrote articles about it in magazines. They said it was his best work. They loved his strange symbols. They loved his strange colors. Frenhofer's painting reminded everyone that just because something was new didn't mean that it was bad. He also helped them to realize that sometimes it takes people a little time to understand great things.

Unit 13: The Farmer and the cats
Arthur was a responsible farmer, and Maria was a nice lady. But they were poor. They owed the town lord money for their land. One summer, their farm  burned. One structure caught fire and most of the animals ran away. Only the cats stayed. So Arthur and Maria had to bring in thier crops without an animal's help.

On a fall day. the lord demanded his money. Arthur asked if the lord could wait until he brought in his crops.

The lord was angry. He raised his hands high and yelled "Pay me by the end of the week. If you dont, I will increase the money you have to pay. I might put you in a jail cell"

So Arthur and Maria worked until there was blood on their hands. They finished four lines of corn and went to bed.

But the next morning, eight lines were finished ! "Maria, didn't we stop in this spot here?"  Arthur asked.

"Yes that is correct. And the tools were in a different position, too" Maria said. They were surprised and happy. Thay day, they worked hard and finished five lines.

But in this morning, ten lines were dont ! Each day they did a lot of work. Each night, someone else did an equal amount of work. In a week, the whole field was finished "Tomorrow I will sell the crops and pay the lord" Arthur said. But that morning, the crops were gone. A bag was in the middle of the field. It contained money.

"Maria, let's see who has helped us work" Through a hole in the wall, they saw a funny sight. The cats were dancing in the field and earing corn! Now Arthur knew that hap happended. The cats had worked at night! After that, Arthur was very nice to his cats and fed them lots of corn
