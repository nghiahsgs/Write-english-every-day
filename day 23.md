Day 16: Adams County's Gold
Adams Academy was a good school. Boys lived there and took classes. Tom worked hard all week. On a spring Saturday, he wanted to do something fun!

He asked his frind Jeff to go to the movie theater "Sorry" Jeff answered "I am going to a concert"

So Tom asked Joe to go to the movie. But Joe's soccer team had a game.

Next Tom went down the hall to Brad's room. Brad was reading a very large old book "Hi, Brad" Tom said "Are you reading a dictionary? It looks ancient"

"No. This is called The Wealth of Adams County. It's about hidden gold in Adams Country. It's more than a century old. I was published in 1870! Look, it even has the original cover on it"

Tom asked "Where did you get it?"

"It's from my dad's friend. He is a nice gentleman, an officer in the army" answered Brad.

"The gold doesn't really exist, does it?" TOm asked.

"I don't know, but maybe! There are clues to in in this book. Let's find it" Looking for gold sounded like fun.

The first clue was to find a flat tree underground. "It must be in the forest" TOm said.

Brad said "the flat tree could be a board under the dirt. It could cover the gold"

TOm and Brad dug in the dirt all morning. The process of looking for goal made them hungry. THey were ready to stop for lunch. But then Brad hit something hard. It was a board.

Broad pounded on the board until it broke. THere was a mall hole under it. "Look" he held up a gold coin.

Tom saw a piece of paper in the hold "Brad, there's more. It's a map to the rest of the gold!"

Brad smiled "Let's go!" ANd they hurried to find the wealth of Adams Country

Unit 17: The Race for Water
There was a town next to a river. The people there had a lot of water. But they wasted it. That made the Sky angry. It said "If you waste water, I will take it away from you" But people didn
t listen.

When the season chaned from spring to summer, the clouds disappeared. The bright sun was hot and made the river dry. There was no water available. People ased "When will the rain fall?"

Th Sky's response was "YOu do not appreciate water. You waste it, and now I will never make rain again"

A boy determined that this wasn't fair. The thought of solution. He asked the Sky to race him. He said "If I get to the top of that hill before you rain can form puddles, you must fill our river"

The Sky laughed "Little boy, I am the SKy. I am above everything else. You cannot beat me". But the boy knew he would win.

When the race begn, the boy ran forward. The SKy started raining on the hill. But puddles did not form there. When it rained on the hill, the water went down.

The Sk kept raing. The water flowed down into the river. When the boy reached to top of the hill, the river was full. The people began to celebrate. It was the highest level the river had ever been at before.

The SKy was angry "A boy can't beat me! I won't fill your river" Now the boy laughed "It doesn't matter whether you want to full it or not" he said "You really did" The sky looked the full river.

"You tricked me" it said. It asked the people "Do you appreciate water now"

"Yes" they said "We won't waste it"

That is how a lone boy saved his town and won the race for water
